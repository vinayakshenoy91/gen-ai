Unsupervised learning:
-----------------------
- Uncovering hidden patterns from unlabellled data 
Ex: Customer segmentation - grouping customers into distinct categories (clustering)
- Classification problems

Classifying labels of unseen data:
1) Build a model
2) Model learns from the labeled data we pass to it
3) Pass unlabeled data to the model as input
4) Model predicts the labels of the unseen data

Supervised learning:
--------------------
- The predicted values are known
Ex: Predicting data, given the features

1) Classification: Target variables consists of categories
- Binary classification
2) Regression: Target variables is continuous
Feature = predictor variable = independent variable
Target variable = dependent variable = response variable

Things to take care wrto supervised learning:
- No missing values
- Data in numeric format
- Data stored in pandas DF or NumPy array
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) first

Algo:
----
1) k-nearest neighbours:
Predict the label of a data point by
- Looking at the k closest labeled data points
- Taking a majority vote
