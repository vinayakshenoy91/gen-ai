How will the crew work together?
---------------------------------

Here are some key takeaways from Crews and their applications:

Role & task definitions shape writing style and tone.
Model choice impacts quality, depth, and style of generated insights.
Adaptability allows applying the setup to diverse use cases.

CrewAI Flows:
--------------
(CrewAI Flows provides this through an event-driven orchestration framework.)

Define the memory for the Flow:
--------------------------------
The state model, or memory, is like a shared notebook that all agents can read and write to. 
It persists data throughout the entire workflow execution.
In CrewAI, it is defined as a Pydantic class.

from typing import Dict, Any
from pydantic import BaseModel

# CODE: Define the state model and add its fields
class ContentState(BaseModel):
  """
  State model that tracks information throughout the content creation workflow.

  Think of this as a form that gets filled out as the workflow progresses:
  - Start: Only URL is filled
  - After routing: Content type is determined
  - After processing: Final content is ready
  - Throughout: Metadata can be added by any step
  """
  url: str = "" # CODE
  content_type: str = ""  
  final_content: str = ""  
  metadata: Dict[str, Any] = {} # CODE


Why use state?
--------------
💾 Data Persistence: Information flows between different workflow steps
✅ Type Safety: Pydantic ensures data integrity
🔄 Flexibility: Easy to add new fields as workflow evolves
🐞 Debugging: Clear view of what data exists at each step

- Note decision making and memory are required for scaling
