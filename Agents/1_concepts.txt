AI - Field of study and set of tech that enable computer system to perform tasks
that typically require human intelligence.
(Decisions, learning, language, reasoning)

AI workflows: 
- Deterministic sequences of steps. Use AI in one or more steps.
- High level of control on the flow
- Useful for tasks with known inputs and outputs
- Involves some thinking and revision
- It is a process where a LLM based app executes multiple steps to complete a task


Degree of autonomy of agents:


AI agents : 
- System that leverages AI model to interact with its env to achieve a user defined objective.
It is capable of reasoning, planning, and acting to fulfil tasks
- Create and execute plans based on pre-defined instruction and tools.
Use AI for planning and executing partially.
- AI creates a plan and devs allows it to access the tools to execute the plan.
- LLMs can just predict tokens
- Low/moderate level control as you do not know which tools will be used when.
- Useful for tasks with unknown inputs and outputs
- Agent is an Ai component that does specific job. It has a role (job that AI agent is designed to perform), 
goal and a backstory (history and context).It has an LLM attached to it.

AI agent has:
------------
1) Brain: Language model
2) Body: Tools 


Multi-agents:
- Team of AI agents that work together to solve a problem
Each agent has a role, goal and sometimes tool.
Ex: Manus, Magnetic one, Agile coder
Frameowrk used: Langchain/Lang smith, AutoGen, Google ADK, LamaIndex

AI applications:
- Appications that contains code + LLM

When an AI agent is needed?
- Complex queries, unstructured data, difficult to maintain rules, adaptive problem solving
- Agentic solution with tool access
- Can generate remediation stratagies and update systems

Orchestration layer maintains :
- Model reasoning and planning
- Long and short term memory
- Instructions


React framework:
----------------
- Reasoning
- Acting

Multiagent:
-----------
- Execute workflows across multiple coordinated agents

Guard rails:
------------

Things to take care of for real world:
--------------------------------------
- Design useful prompts with context
- Understand agent capabilities and limitations
- Verify agent outputs
- Mindful of costs
- Use AI agents responsibly

Buildign best practices:
------------------------
- Design for human intervention. When to handoff
- Analyse if you event need an agent
- costs and perf
- Start simple and iterate
- Monitor and measure

When use agents?
-----------------
- Open end prompts
- Complex tasks
- Adaptive

Getting production ready:
-------------------------
1) Validate real interactions
2) Unit and integration testing, Evaluate system prompts
Subjective evaluation (LLM as judge or human rater)
3) Guardrails and observability  - Content filter, model or tool failure, fallback
Logging
4) Shadow deployments
5) Deployment strategies - A/B testing, user segmentation, human in loop

Checklist:
- Handle messy inputs
- Logs
- Filters
- testing
- Gradual deployment
- observability
